 &gt; Hi,
 &gt; 
 &gt; I'm going to post a formal response to the posting on JLUG after I talk
 &gt; with Linus, but it will probably take a few days to do that since I'll 
 &gt; need to type it in Japanese and translate some of the communication
 &gt; between me and Linus. So, here are a few quick comments (I type
 &gt; English about 90 times faster than Japanese ... and my English typing
 &gt; isn't lightning fast): 
 &gt; 
 &gt; 1. Motivation for application of the trademark
 &gt; 
 &gt; The motivation for applying for the Linux trademark in Japan was to
 &gt; prevent another fiasco like the one that occurred last year in the
 &gt; US. There was company that makes a product completely unrelated to 
 &gt; Linux that registered the Linux trademark and tried to prevent
 &gt; "real" Linux companies from using the mark. A legal battle ended in
 &gt; the trademark being transferred to Linus. Linux International (a group 
 &gt; of Linux vendors and supporting companies, mainly US based, but
 &gt; officially "international") helped in securing lawyers and pushing the 
 &gt; legal process through.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I am on the Linux International Board and I offered to look into the
 &gt; situation and help out in applying for a trademark in Japan. 
 &gt; 

If there is the proctection already due to Paris Treaty as JLUG poeple 
claim, Is the applicatioo unnecessary?

 &gt; 2. Use of Linux trademark, GPL-ish license
 &gt; 
 &gt; The purpose for having the Linux trademark is to prevent misuse of the mark
 &gt; by non-Linux oriented companies as had happened in the US. It is also
 &gt; to promote the wide use of the "Linux" trademark and Linux in
 &gt; general. Linux International intends to have a lawyer draft a GPL type 
 &gt; license for its use but has not done so yet.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Normally a trademark is used to *restrict* others from  using it so 
 &gt; that a company can protect its product brand. Making a trademark 
 &gt; available for others to use widely is somewhat new territory, like the 
 &gt; GPL license is to copyright. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; PHT's request that companies using the mark also refer to a Linux
 &gt; trademark web page (PHT's or their own or a page by some other 3rd
 &gt; party) is an attempt to make the use of the mark "recursive" or
 &gt; "self-referential", kind of like the GPL license requires that a copy
 &gt; of the license be distributed in perpetuity with derivative
 &gt; works. I may not have found the best way to do this, but it was an
 &gt; attempt. 
 &gt; 

I really don't think using Linux name to other business makes any
profitable.  Why prevent them from doing that? 


 &gt; 3. 根回し (nemawashi, or, getting consensus before the plunge)
 &gt; 
 &gt; The first person that I talked with was the big penguin himself,
 &gt; Linus. I told him that PHT would be happy to go ahead and undertake
 &gt; the formalities of registering the trademark. I suggested that PHT be
 &gt; a joint holder so that we could take care of things in Japan, purely an
 &gt; administrative role. The offer was "no strings attached" -- I told him 
 &gt; that PHT would be happy to do all of this without being a joint holder 
 &gt; as well, if that was what he wanted. Linus responded that it made
 &gt; sense for PHT to be a joint holder.
 &gt; 
 &gt; In Japan, this seems to be where I didn't do enough consensus
 &gt; building. I talked with some people in the Linux community here before
 &gt; going ahead with the registration. Seems that I didn't talk with
 &gt; enough of the right people soon enough. I had wanted to talk with the
 &gt; head of JLUG beforehand, but due to conflicting schedules, it ended up
 &gt; that I didn't actually talk with him until afterwards. I talked with
 &gt; people at TLUG, but I believe that may have been after applying for
 &gt; the trademark -- I'd have to check my email archives.
 &gt; 

I really don't think it has anything to do with Japan culture.


 &gt; 4. What if??
 &gt; 
 &gt; So what if the bad guys take over PHT or PHT becomes evil? 
 &gt; 
 &gt; When I talked with Linus, I told him that we would like to give him
 &gt; the right to take back complete control of the trademark for any
 &gt; reason at any time. This is clearly documented in email between Linus
 &gt; and myself (which will be made public soon).
 &gt; 
 &gt; More later,

People here are acting like there is money for Linux.
Is there?
Getting out of hand from the initial intention.

Regards,
Kei.
