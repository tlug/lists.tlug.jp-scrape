Hi Derek,

I am not sure, but it seems it happens mainly if I am using any OOo
application before. And the only help is to kill the process &quot;soffice&quot; by
hand. I can understand that if some OOo application crashes it may affect
OOo QuickStarter as a common in-memory-loaded library for all OOo
applications. But I have not the same problem with the same version OOo on
Win2K and WinXP.... just on Win98 and WinME. Please, what helped you fix
this problem ?

Thx a lot in advance...

Hi,   I've had this problem but NOT as a regular thing - only after some
time when a problem seems to have arisen in OO.  Is this what happens with
you or is it every time?

hello,

I have translated all the licenses approved by OSI, 
in www.opensource.org/licenses/ .
Sun Industry Standards Source License(SISSL) is one of them.
Now I want to publish the translations for research and education use. 
I need the grant of the copyright owner of the license.
This may be a legal thing and not the scope of your business.
But do you know whom I should contact ? Email is preferred.
I am looking forward to your reply.

(I am not a lawyer but)if you have translated the licenses, then
there should be no problem publishing the translations as the
licenses themselves cannot be copyright as that would be counter
to their purpose.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, but for most medium to large companies, the biggest hurdles are

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) they are already heavily invested in MS products

There are enough differences besides file formats for companies with

&gt; &gt; &gt; products no matter how compatible or feature rich will always require
&gt; &gt; &gt; some level of retraining of admins and/or users.

Sorry but this topic is *not* about transitioning to Linux but the easier
transition to OOo! Quite a different topic and at least initially a much 
easier &quot;sell&quot;.


&gt; People must realize that whining because the little icon in
&gt; the corner is changed, or some menu voice is two columns left is
&gt; ridiculous, and certainly doesn't need training. Some good online
&gt; tutorial, maybe, but not training . The average grandma who never
&gt; touched any PC needs assistance regardless of the program (don't even
&gt; try to say that MS Office or Windows are more intuitive than others to
&gt; somebody who never touched any PC): the average employee of the modern
&gt; company can switch by himself.
Many &quot;average&quot; users take time to learn that feature X in this product is
called feature Y in the old product and is found in a different menu. This
&quot;cost&quot; can hamper the adoption.

I know (see what I said about users heavily relying on macros, for
example). However, at least listening to some CTOs, the real issues
seldom come up, and the file format even less than others.

Which is exactly what I said too: the paragraph you are answering to
is not mine, I answered to it saying &quot;Which training?&quot;,  for the same
reason (OOo being on windows too).

Another problem with downloading OpenOffice is that it is 51-71MB. Most
people are still on dialup and could not download such as large file. A
small (under 4MB) reader would be ideal for a dialup user.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;True, but also for documents uploaded to a web server.
&gt; &gt;Problem already presented to this list, I am very glad that it is
&gt; &gt;presented again. See this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;<A  HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=137416&amp;listName=discuss">http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=137416&amp;listName=discuss</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;and all the related discussions happened in those days
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Overall, this strategy has the effect of using the current base of
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt;OpenOffice / StarOffice users to get all their family and friends
&gt; &gt;  &gt;to download OpenOffice readers and ignite a mass chain reaction...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Definitely! As it should be obvious by the quoted message, I hope that
&gt; &gt;your suggestion is implemented (The &quot;add a link to OOo website with
&gt; &gt;any attachment&quot; part). As far as the reader itself goes, I have
&gt; &gt;nothing against it, but a couple of comments are in order:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1) Documents meant for read only use should be made available in read
&gt; &gt;only formats, regardless of the native format and which software
&gt; &gt;created it. This has already pointed out several times (even in a
&gt; &gt;MS-Office only world, or OOo only world, it would reduce the
&gt; &gt;probability of distributing viral macros)
&gt; &gt;(Er, probably in this case editable is OK, as long as it is stripped
&gt; &gt;of any executable code inside)
&gt; &gt;2) OOo readers have been already asked for here time and again, and
&gt; &gt;nothing came of it because people said they would be almost as big as
&gt; &gt;the complete thing, and for other reasons which I don't remember.
&gt; &gt;Are those reasons still valid? If not, why?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(As far as I am concerned, causing the mass chain reaction that you
&gt; &gt;mention is a necessary and sufficient reaction to do it)
&gt; &gt;

If the book gets the OK, Wiley will need to decide whether to include a CD of 
OpenOffice with the book. This will make the book more costly to produce. Do 
you think including a CD of OpenOffice would be a good idea?

yes, absolutely! As mentioned in previous posts, one of the obstacles to
OOO's diffusion is the size of its download, which is prohibitive for
dialup users (I did it once -- never again). Having a CD, perhaps a
credit-card or mini-CD that you can carry around in a shirt pocket, would
be great, with room enough for both Linux and Windows versions and for a
good range of spellchecking files in various languages.

I would say to Wiley, absolutely yes, there is a market, and a growing one,
for OOo and SO for dummies!  OOo and SO are huge in Europe, and are growing in
the US.  I speak to so many newbies who ask for such a book!

Training, shaimning, if you have someone who can use MS Word, they can use
OOo.  I never took any training, and I figured out how to use OOo just fine.

Since the online help is more of a reference this book would be very useful
for all the beginners.

I think that since OpenOffice can be easily downloaded, is available with most
(all?) Linux distro's and has been available on many magazines's front covers
it would be a better idea to keep the price of the book down.

As I have mentioned, there is no question about the large number of
million users of OOox.0 that are expected over the next few years at
today adoption run-rate (we have est. 3-5 million users today), but
there may be doubt about their willingness to pay for a book.

This may be because users of office suites consider themselves competent
enough, or because OOo is free and the price of a book seems larger by
comparison...not logical but true.  People feel that a $279-579 purchase
of software justifies a $39 book purchase more readily than a free suite
justifies a similar consideration for the same book.

OOo for Dummies as a title may put off some readers.  30% of OOo User
Survey respondents run it on Linux at this time.  The Dummies bit does
not translate to Unix users the same as it does to Windows users.  Unix
users have no reason for such self-effacement ;-)

Also, the OOo Community is expecting a large number of Mac users to
enter the picture when the OOo for OS X is launched early '04.  This may
be a consideration unless the book is aimed only at Windows users.

My opinion: Wiley would do well to publish a good book on OOo not having
'Dummies' in the title.  It ought to complement the Jones/Haugland
effort and not substantially duplicate it.  If you need the complete OOo
user stats run down before that meeting, give me a call.

I donít think the CD is necessary.  Instead, you could just mention on the inside cover page in big bold letters the web site for the free download of the product.  This would lower the cost of the book for the end user which in turn may  promote sales.

After reading some feedbacks on the CD inclusion issue, I am revising my recommendation.  I think that it would be a good idea to include the CD.  This is mainly because although connections in US and Canada are reliable for large downloads, overseas connections are not so reliable.  

Also, the inclusion of the CD also allows people to loan the CD to all their friends who can make copies of it and all this generally increases the uptake of the product - especially overseas where net connections are not so reliable.

After reading some feedbacks on the CD inclusion issue, I am revising my recommendation.  I think that it would be a good idea to include the CD.  This is mainly because although connections in US and Canada are reliable for large downloads, overseas connections are not so reliable.  

Also, the inclusion of the CD also allows people to loan the CD to all their friends who can make copies of it and all this generally increases the uptake of the product - especially overseas where net connections are not so reliable.

I have been participating on the users list, but only occasionally reading 
the archives for this one. (Not enough hours in the day.) I hope this post 
is not out of line.

I haven't mentioned this before as I didn't want to be accused of 
inappropriate advertising, but given the recent discussion I thought I 
should let you know know that I am writing a book titled &quot;Taming 
OpenOffice.org Writer&quot; which is aimed at people who are new to OOo but are 
intermediate or advanced users of Microsoft Word or some other word 
processing program.

I see my book as a supplement to other books (including any proposed 
&quot;Dummies&quot; book and the ones forthcoming from Solveig and other people), 
because I cover fewer topics but go into them in more detail. It will NOT 
cover the entire suite of OOo apps.

The book will be available as shareware in downloadable PDF format and also 
as a printed book. Intended publication date is March 2003. It will NOT 
include a CD.

As soon as I have time, I will post a draft table of contents and other 
information on my website. The topics will be similar to those in my 
&quot;Taming Microsoft Word&quot; series (see sig). Some of the material will also be 
available (free) through my website.

If you want to discuss this with me, please send a copy of your note to me 
as well as to the list. I will not have a chance to keep up (or catch up) 
with this list until late this month, but I will be occasionally collecting 
my email.

&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to appear too negative about this suggestion but aren't
&gt; there a couple of problems with it?
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, to my knowledge there is no such reader program available at
&gt; present.  In fact there is no option to download and install individual
&gt; components of the office suite, e,g. install only swriter by itself. 

Would it be very difficult to develop a small file size reader software with minimal editing capabilities?  If not then I think it would be well worth the effort to put one out as it really makes OO much more functional in a MS Office dominated community.


&gt; Secondly,  the e-mail component of OpenOffice has been removed.  I do
&gt; not know if there is an e-mail component bundled with StarOffice 6.0 but
&gt; suspect that there is not.  The function of adding a link to any email
&gt; containing a writer document automatically would surely have to be
&gt; accomplished by en e-mail client program.  
&gt; 
&gt; If office somehow could programmatically automatically insert links into
&gt; arbitrary e-mails then that surely would be a major security risk.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my initial thoughts on first reading.
&gt; 
&gt; Graeme
&gt; 
 

Good point.  Two possible solutions for this that I can think of on first impressions:


1) During installation, OpenOffice could detect what type of email client the user has installed on his computer and offer to install a plug-in to the email client that would add this functionality.  For example, if the user has Outlook, then the plug-in could add a signature file containing the link to the OO Reader download site to the end of any emails which have OO file attachments.

2) OpenOffice could be co-marketed with Chandler which is due out soon.  (Chandler is an open source version of Outlook being developed by Lotus founder Mitch Kapur).  We could co ordinate plans with Mitch Kapurís team and request them to develop a version of Chandler specifically for OpenOffice which would be capable of adding the signature file containing the OO Reader download link to any emails which contain OO file attachments.

I actually prefer the second approach as it seems easier to accomplish from a software engineering perspective.  Also, with the ability to bundle both OO and Chandler on the same CD or the same download session, everything is rendered much more user friendly for the end user.

</ul>
<pre>
Hi, 

On August 16, Norm Loewen posted this: 

&gt; I noticed that you can set colors with CMYK values. Is there a way (or
&gt; will there be in the future) to have those stay has 4 color values in
&gt; a PDF and not convert to RGB? 

I didn't notice any answer. I think a feature like that would be really
important to print high quality document as CMYK is the standard in the
printing industry. 

I would add that it would be important that OO could have that feature
also when Printing as a Postscript file. I tend to thing that these two
features are related. 

I am planning to use OO as a tool for a Database publishing solution and
this behavior (transforming CMYK colors into RGB colors when printing in
the Postscript file) is really a *BIG* weakness. 

It's sad because on the other hand OO has a major strength to develop
this kind of applications. Its open XML format, would allow to develop
sophisticated Database publishing applications based on OO for which the
*other suite*, due to its proprietary file format would be in a weaker
position.

Maybe there are just some settings to change? If not, is this feature
implementation on the OO developers radar screen or should I post it as
an issue?

&gt; &gt; Any pointers as to how to start?  I would really appreciate some sample

&gt; &gt; in OOo calc.  Am I right?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Roland
&gt; 
&gt; The best place to look is probably on the OOo web site
&gt; (www.openoffice.org) with the SDK and Programmer's Tutorial.
&gt; 

the two special sites dealing with what probably falls most under object model 
are udk.openoffice.org and api.openoffice.org. the later will likely cover anything
realted to something being used from a basic macro

&gt; The macro recorder is currently part of the 643c development version. It
&gt; will be integrated into the mainstream code at a later date.

&gt; (I am not a lawyer but)if you have translated the licenses, then
&gt; there should be no problem publishing the translations as the
&gt; licenses themselves cannot be copyright as that would be counter
&gt; to their purpose.
I wish the thing could be what you said. But in fact it is not. :)
Translation is derivative work and I should grant 
the right or let the original author to check it before publishing.
And I also have obligation to meet the requirement of the copyright owner.
I expect after that I should be able to publish it for educational use.

Hello, everyone!  I donít think I properly introduced myself to the list.  Iím a physician based in Canada.  I do family practice with emerg. shifts in Ontario.  

Although I just signed up with OpenOffice.org, I have no programming knowledge myself.  (May be this will change in the future!).  However, I recently got married to a programmer who has working knowledge of C++ and Java.  

At present, I wish to contribute my skills to the OpenOffice.org effort from a professional user perspective in helping to design the user interface.  My wife is currently studying to become a Palm os developer and  by end of the year, she may also like to contribute her skills to the OpenOffice effort.

I am still a bit confused about how all this open source process works but hope to get the hang of things gradually.
